Running

Cloud9 workspaces come with redis pre-installed.

Start the server:

sudo service redis-server start

Connect with the client:

redis-cli

You can then connect to the database with following parameters:
Option 	Value 	Comment
`Hostname` 	`$IP` 	The same local IP as the application you run on Cloud9
`Port` 	`6379` 	The default Redis port number
`Password` 	`` 	No password since you can only access the DB from within the workspace
